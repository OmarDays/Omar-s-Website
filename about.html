    <h1 id="top">LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB</h1>

    
    <h2>A Brief History</h2>

    <p>Liverpool Football Club is one of England's most successful teams having won many trophies including 19 League Titles and 6 European Cups since the club was founded in 1892.
    <br>As well as an extensive trophy cabinet. The club is famous for providing viewers with entertaining attacking football and has one of the most passionate footballng fan-bases.
    <br>The legendary LFC history begins in 1892... a famous year that has been ingrained in its logo's crest. Originally their Anfield premises belonged to local rivals Everton FC,
    <br>but then owing to a business decision, it caused them to leave and form a new ground at Goodison Park. It was a witty local businessman John Houlding whose plan was to make
    <br>use of the empty stadium, which resulted in creating a new football team...Liverpool FC, and well the rest is history...
